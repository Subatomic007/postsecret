    alt_text: I feel like people keep forgetting that there is a human being with feelings on the other side of the computer screen. I've had people *yell* at me online, tell me I'm being useless. They wouldn't have the courage to say that to my face, and I struggle to have the courage to pick myself up again now that people around me are targeting their anger and stress towards me. It breaks my heart that the community in my class seems to have collapsed since moving online. These people used to be my family, and now I'm fairly certain many of them hate me. I know there is nothing I can do, angry people will be angry and I can't please everyone, but it still stings.

    alt_text: With all my friends in Waterloo and me living at home, I'm worried that they'll forget about me :( I hope they don't get caught up in their own lives and think about me like I think about them.

    alt_text: I feel like I'm always the tag-along. I'm no ones number one, I'm just someone who happens to be invited, and is tolerated, not anticipated. I just wish people cared more about having me there, and that people wanted to spend time with me alone, not just as part of the group

    alt_text: I stole the ASG sign from the SYDE lounge. It was meant to be a joke with a big punch line that everyone would see. A week later campus was shut down and I couldn’t reveal the punch line or return it to the SYDE lounge. It’s been chilling in my room for 6 months, a constant reminder of the all-encompassing guilt I feel.
