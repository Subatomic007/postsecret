    alt_text: I feel like people keep forgetting that there is a human being with feelings on the other side of the computer screen. I've had people *yell* at me online, tell me I'm being useless. They wouldn't have the courage to say that to my face, and I struggle to have the courage to pick myself up again now that people around me are targeting their anger and stress towards me. It breaks my heart that the community in my class seems to have collapsed since moving online. These people used to be my family, and now I'm fairly certain many of them hate me. I know there is nothing I can do, angry people will be angry and I can't please everyone, but it still stings.

    alt_text: With all my friends in Waterloo and me living at home, I'm worried that they'll forget about me :( I hope they don't get caught up in their own lives and think about me like I think about them.
