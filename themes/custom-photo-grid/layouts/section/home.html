            The original Post-Secret project started in 2005, where people mailed in anonymous 
            postcards with an unspoken and honest secret as contributions to an ongoing art project. 
            While the original project operated as a continuously updating art exhibit both on and 
            offline, numerous other post-secret movements have sprung up, including one right at 
            Waterloo Engineering.

            With the passing of Professor Igor Ivkovic, a beloved professor from the Systems 
            Engineering Department, and former Dean Pearl Sullivan, who enthusiastically 
            held the position for 7 years, we want to offer this space to students to 
            share their thoughts, stories, struggles, and grief. Post-Secret wants to 
            provide a channel for students to grieve the losses together. 
            By posting in a public location, this term on our virtual wall, students can 
            read and share in the knowledge that others have similar thoughts and that 
            they really are not alone.
